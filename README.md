Use pull requests and merge as you go. 

## Assignment Requirements

(Follow the steps described below to update the To-Do list using CSS.) 

1. Add a background image of some kind to the page - theme it however you like, but it should have something to do with a “to-do” list;
2. Add a header to the page and use an H1 tag (and others, if you like) to give your page a creative title. Use an ID attribute and CSS selector to style the header and its content;
3. Use generic element selectors, IDs and classes where appropriate and make the build your own - change colors, fonts, etc. Feel free to explore Google Fonts as a solution;
4. Add an input element with a type of checkbox to each “in progress” and each “done” list item in the “in progress” and “done” lists;
5. When you check an “in progress” list item, use the appropriate selector to also/additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately;
6. When you check a “done” item, use the appropriate selector to also /additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately;
